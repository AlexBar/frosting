# Frosting

[![AppVeyor branch](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/cakebuild/frosting/develop.svg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cakebuild/frosting/branch/develop) 
[![MyGet](https://img.shields.io/myget/cake/vpre/Cake.Frosting.svg?label=myget)](https://www.myget.org/feed/cake/package/nuget/Cake.Frosting)

A .NET Core host for Cake, that allows you to write your build scripts as a 
portable console application (`netstandard1.0`). Frosting is currently 
in alpha, but more information, documentation and samples will be added soon.

**Expect things to move around initially. Especially naming of things.**

## Example

### 1. Add nuget.config

Start by adding a `nuget.config` file to your project.  
The reason for this is that Cake.Frosting is in preview at the moment and not
available on [nuget.org](https://nuget.org).

```xml
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="nuget.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
    <add key="myget.org" value="https://www.myget.org/F/cake/api/v3/index.json" protocolVersion="3" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

### 2. Add project.json

Now create a `project.json` file that will tell `dotnet` what dependencies are required
to build our program. The `Cake.Frosting` package will decide what version of `Cake.Core` and `Cake.Common`
you will get.

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0-*",
  "buildOptions": {
    "emitEntryPoint": true
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "Cake.Frosting": "0.1.0-alpha0007",
    "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
      "type": "platform",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "netcoreapp1.0": {
      "imports": "dnxcore50"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Program.cs

For the sake of keeping the example simple, all classes are listed after each other, 
but you should of course treat the source code of your build scripts like any other
code and divide them up in individual files.

```csharp
using Cake.Common.Diagnostics;
using Cake.Core;
using Cake.Core.Diagnostics;
using Cake.Frosting;

public class Program
{
    public static int Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create the host.
        var host = new CakeHostBuilder()
            .WithArguments(args)
            .ConfigureServices(services =>
            {
                // Use a custom settings class.
                services.UseContext<MySettings>();
            })
            .Build();

        // Run the host.
        return host.Run();
    }
}

public class MySettings : FrostingContext
{
    public bool Magic { get; set; }

    public MySettings(ICakeContext context)
        : base(context)
    {
        // You could also use a CakeLifeTime<Settings>
        // to provide a Setup method to setup the context.
        Magic = context.Arguments.HasArgument("magic");
    }
}

[TaskName("Provide-Another-Name-Like-This")]
public class Build : FrostingTask<MySettings>
{
    public override bool ShouldRun(MySettings context)
    {
        // Don't run this task on OSX.
        return context.Environment.Platform.Family != PlatformFamily.OSX;
    }

    public override void Run(MySettings context)
    {
        context.Information("Magic: {0}", context.Magic);
    }
}

[Dependency(typeof(Build))]
public class Default : FrostingTask
{
    // If you don't inherit from the generic task
    // the standard ICakeContext will be provided.
}
``` 

### 4. Run it!

To execute the build, simply run it like any .NET Core application.  
In the example we provide the custom `--magic` argument. Notice that
we use `--` to separate the arguments to the `dotnet` command.

```powershell
> dotnet restore
> dotnet run -- --magic
```

The API for configuring and running the host have been heavily influenced by 
the [ASP.NET Core hosting API](https://github.com/aspnet/Hosting).
